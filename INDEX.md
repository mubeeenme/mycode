## 💡 Key Concepts Explained

### **What is "Vibe Coding"?**
Plain-language commands you give to Framer's AI to create design elements without writing code. Example: "Create a hero section with a bold headline and a call-to-action button."

### **What is "Edge Computing"?**
Running your website from servers close to your customers (Cloudflare's 300+ global locations) for maximum speed.

### **What is "Headless Commerce"?**
Separating your store's frontend (what customers see - Framer) from the backend (business logic - Shopify) for flexibility and performance.

### **Why Cloudflare Workers?**
- ⚡ Fastest possible load times (10-50ms response)
- 🌍 Global reach (300+ edge locations)
- 🛡️ Built-in security (DDoS protection, WAF)
- 💰 Cost-effective (free tier available)
